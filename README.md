Rundeck WinRM Plugin
--------------------

These are a [Rundeck Node Executor plugin][1] and a [Rundeck File Copier plugin][2] that uses WinRM to connect to Windows and execute commands.  It uses the [OverThere Library][3] to provide the WinRM implementation, and uses Basic authentication over HTTPS.

[2]: https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/developer/04-file-copier-plugins.html
[3]: https://github.com/xebialabs/overthere/

Compatible with Rundeck 2.3.x+

Install
====

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/rundeck-plugins/rundeck-winrm-plugin/releases).

Copy the `rundeck-winrm-plugin-x.x.xjar` to the `libext/` directory for Rundeck.

Configure the Remote Windows Node
====

Be sure to follow the directions in the OverThere library for [Setting up a Windows host for Winrm Internal](https://github.com/xebialabs/overthere/#winrm-winrm_internal-and-winrm_native).

If using Kerberos for authentication, also follow these guides:

* [Kerberos - source host](https://github.com/xebialabs/overthere/#kerberos---source-host)
* [Kerberos - remote host](https://github.com/xebialabs/overthere/#kerberos---remote-host)

Configure The Plugin
====

This plugin provides a NodeExecutor and a FileCopier called `overthere-winrm`, which you can set as on your node definition:

	<node name="winNode" node-executor="overthere-winrm" .../>

and/or

	<node name="winNode" file-copier="overthere-winrm" .../>

Or set as the default NodeExecutor for your project/framework properties file, with `service.NodeExecutor.default.provider=overthere-winrm` and `service.FileCopier.default.provider=overthere-winrm`.

These Node attributes are used to connect to the remote host:

* `username` - Remote username. If using Kerberos, see [Using Kerberos Authentication](#using-kerberos-authentication)
* `hostname` - Remote host. Can include "host:port" to specify port number other than the default 5985/5986 (http/https).

Password authentication can be performed in one of two ways:

1. Create a Rundeck Job with a [Secure Authentication Option][1], to pass in the password to use.  The default name
of this option should be "winrmPassword", but you can change the name that is expected, if necessary.
2. Use the Rundeck [Key Storage Facility][2] to store a password, and use the path to it as the `winrm-password-storage-path`

[1]: http://rundeck.org/docs/manual/job-options.html#secure-options
[2]: http://rundeck.org/docs/administration/key-storage.html

These additional configuration attributes can be set on the Node, or in the project.properties or framework.properties. To add them to project.properties, prefix them with "project." and for framework.properties prefix them with "framework.":

* `winrm-connection-timeout` - timeout in milliseconds for connection. (default 15000)
* `winrm-timeout` - WinRM protocol Timeout, in XML Schema Duration format. (Default: `PT60.000S`) see: <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats>
* `winrm-port` - port number to use, if not set in the `hostname` of the Node. (Default: 5985/5986 for http/https)
* `winrm-user` - Username, if not set in the `username` of the Node
* `winrm-protocol` - Determine HTTP(S) protocol to use, either "http" or "https". Default: "https"
* `winrm-auth-type` - Type of authentication to use, "basic" or "kerberos", default: "kerberos".  If the username contains '@domain', then kerberos will be selected.
* `winrm-locale` - Locale to use, default: "en-us".
* `winrm-password-option` - Specifies a [Secure Authentication Option][1] from a Job to use as the authentication password. (format: "NAME" ).
	* default-value: "winrmPassword", so simply define a Secure Authentication Option on your Job with the name "winrmPassword".
* `winrm-password-storage-path` - Specifies a [Key Storage Path][] to look up the authentication password from.  It can contain property references like `${node.name}` to evaluate at runtime.  If specified, it will be used instead of the `winrm-password-option`.

For file copier plugin:
* `file-copy-destination-dir` - Folder location where the remote script to be executed will be copied

Using Kerberos Authentication
====

Kerberos authentication can be used.

Configure these node properties, or set "framework.X" or "project.X" in your framework.properties or project.properties.

* `winrm-cert-trust` - (HTTPS only) certificate trust strategy, "all" (trust all certificates), "self-signed" (trust self-signed in addition to verified), or "default" (trust only verified certificates). Default: "default".
* `winrm-hostname-trust` - (HTTPS only) hostname trust strategy, "all", "strict" or "browser-compatible". Default: "browser-compatible".
* `winrm-kerberos-debug` - true/false, if true, enable debug output for Kerberos authentication. Default: false.
* `winrm-spn-add-port` - true/false, if true, add the port to the SPN used for authentication. Default: false.
* `winrm-spn-use-http` - true/false, if true, use 'HTTP' instead of 'WSMAN' as the protocol for the SPN used for authentication. Default: false.
* `winrm-domain` - Kerberos domain to use if not set via the username.
* `winrm-is-domain-member` - Option to truncate hostname when used as domain for kerberos login. If set to "true", replaces "host.domain.tld" with "domain.tld" appending to username.

The username used for Kerberos authentication is created in this way:

* if `username` value looks like `user@domain` use `username@DOMAIN` (uppercase domain name)
* if username does not contain `@` then:
    * if `winrm-domain` is set, use `username@DOMAIN` (uppercase winrm-domain) 
    * if `winrm-is-domain-member` is "true", then convert hostname of "host.domain.tld" to "domain.tld" and use `username@DOMAIN.TLD`
    * otherwise use `username@HOSTNAME` (uppercase hostname)

Configure Kerberos
----

Kerberos authentication requires you to set up some Java System Properties, or a kb5.conf file to define which domains map to which Domain Controllers.  You can follow the [Kerberos Requirements](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html) for Java.  To simply use a single domain and KDC, set these Java System Props at startup of the Rundeck server:

    -Djava.security.krb5.realm=<example.com> -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=<kdc.example.com>. 

Replace the values with the name of your domain/realm and the hostname of your domain controller.

FAQ
----

If you do not do follow the [Configure Kerberos](#configure-kerberos) section this you will see this error:

    failed: WinRM Error: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Could not load configuration from SCDynamicStore

If your KDC is not reachable you will see this error:

    failed: WinRM Error: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Receive timed out

If your password is incorrect you will see this error:

    failed: WinRM Error: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Pre-authentication information was invalid (24)

If your username is not found you will see this error:

    failed: WinRM Error: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Client not found in Kerberos database (6)

If the system clock differs too much between the nodes you will see this error:

    failed: WinRM Error: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Clock skew too great (37)

If you receive Kerberos authentication error `Server not found in Kerberos database` then you need to define a
"Service Principal Name" for the auth service on the Windows node:

* Run this command:

        setspn -a WSMAN/hostname.domain.com hostname

If your SPN uses a protocol of 'HTTP', or includes the port in the SPN (such as `HTTP/hostname.domain.com:5985`), see
the `winrm-spn-add-port` and `winrm-spn-use-http` configuration options above.

Configure a Windows Server for WinRM
